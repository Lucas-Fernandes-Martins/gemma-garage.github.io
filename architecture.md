## üéØ Design Principles

### Modularity
Each component is independently deployable and scalable, allowing for targeted optimizations and updates without affecting the entire system.

### Cloud-Native
Built from the ground up for Google Cloud Platform, leveraging managed services for reliability and automatic scaling.

### Developer Experience
Prioritizes ease of use with intuitive interfaces, comprehensive logging, and real-time feedback throughout all processes.

### Open Source Foundation
Built on proven open-source libraries and frameworks, contributing back to the community while leveraging collective knowledge.

## üß© Core Modules

### 1. Frontend Module üåê
**Repository**: [gemma-garage-frontend](https://github.com/Gemma-Garage/gemma-garage-frontend)

#### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Deployment**: Firebase Hosting
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **State Management**: React Context + Hooks
- **UI Library**: Material-UI with custom theming

#### Key Features
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile experiences

- **User Management**: Complete authentication flow with profile management
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visual training metrics and model comparison
- **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface with progress indicators

#### Design Decisions
While a dedicated database management system like PostgreSQL might seem more appropriate for production, Firebase's Backend-as-a-Service approach perfectly suits Gemma Garage's current needs:

- **Rapid Development**: Built-in authentication and real-time database
- **Automatic Scaling**: No infrastructure management required
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Live updates without complex WebSocket setup
- **Cost Effectiveness**: Pay-per-use model ideal for research projects

*Future Consideration*: As the platform scales beyond research scope, migration to a dedicated PostgreSQL instance may be justified for advanced querying and data analysis capabilities.
