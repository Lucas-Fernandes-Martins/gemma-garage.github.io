## üéØ Research Mission

After establishing the core Gemma Garage platform, our research phase focused on pushing the boundaries of what's possible with small language models. The central question driving our research was: **How can we dramatically improve mathematical reasoning in compact models using modern optimization techniques?**

## üî¨ Research Methodology

### Experimental Setup

Our research centered on **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**, a reinforcement learning technique specifically designed for LLM fine-tuning with judge models.

#### Target Model
- **Base Model**: Gemma 3 1B Instruct
- **Task**: Mathematical reasoning and problem-solving
- **Evaluation**: GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K) dataset
- **Secondary Evaluation**: AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination)

#### GRPO Configuration
- **Judge Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Evaluation Approach**: LLM-as-Judge with custom rubric
- **Group Size**: Optimized for stable relative rankings
- **Reward Normalization**: Within-group standardization

## üìä Breakthrough Results

  <figcaption style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;">Dramatic improvement in GSM8K accuracy through GRPO fine-tuning</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Quantitative Improvements
- **Baseline Accuracy**: <3% on GSM8K dataset
- **Post-GRPO Accuracy**: >50% on GSM8K dataset
- **Improvement Factor**: **>16x performance gain**
- **Training Efficiency**: Achieved in reasonable compute time on consumer hardware

#### Qualitative Improvements
Beyond raw accuracy, we observed significant improvements in:

- **Solution Structure**: Better adherence to expected mathematical problem-solving format
- **Step-by-step Reasoning**: More logical progression through problem-solving steps
- **Answer Clarity**: Cleaner final answer presentation
- **Consistency**: More reliable performance across different problem types

### Key Research Insights

#### 1. **GRPO Effectiveness for Small Models**
Our experiments definitively demonstrate that **reinforcement learning is viable and highly effective** for enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models. This challenges the common assumption that only large models benefit significantly from RL fine-tuning.

#### 2. **Judge Model Stability**
GRPO's group-relative approach proved particularly robust in LLM-as-Judge scenarios. The relative ranking within groups remained consistent even when absolute scores fluctuated, leading to stable training dynamics.

#### 3. **Emergent Format Improvement**
Remarkably, we observed significant improvements in response formatting **without explicit reward shaping for structure**. The model naturally learned to follow mathematical problem-solving conventions through the basic rubric alone.

#### 4. **Hardware Accessibility**
The entire fine-tuning process, including GRPO, was successfully conducted on consumer-grade hardware, making these techniques accessible to individual researchers and small teams.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### GRPO Algorithm Details

#### Core Concept
Group Relative Policy Optimization addresses a key challenge in RL fine-tuning: **reward model inconsistency**. Instead of relying on absolute reward scores, GRPO:

1. **Groups responses** into batches for evaluation
2. **Ranks responses** within each group
3. **Normalizes rewards** based on relative performance
4. **Updates policy** based on relative improvements

#### Advantages Over Traditional Approaches
- **Reduced Variance**: Less sensitive to judge model inconsistencies
- **Stable Training**: More predictable convergence patterns
- **Computational Efficiency**: Fewer evaluation calls required
- **Robust Performance**: Maintains effectiveness across different judge models
